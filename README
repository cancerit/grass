To get the equivalent of old Grass's output run with the -use_all_biotypes and the -gene_id_required flags and supply ensembl connection details.


Comparing old and new grass. Example commands...

old Grass (in svn and /software) command:
/software/CGP/projects/Grass/perl/scripts/grass.pl -remote -ensembl_api 74 -coord X:-:84500101-84500632,X:+:84510265-84510265    
(this uses the remote ensembl server - ensembl 74 isn't installed locally)

PanCan grass (in git) equivalent command (for comparison with old Grass):
perl -I /software/CGP/projects/vagrent_vcf/perl/modules/ ~/CGP_git/grass/bin/grass.pl -species HUMAN -ensembl_api /software/pubseq/PerlModules/Ensembl/www_74_1 -gene_id_required -use_all_biotypes -coord X:-:84500101-84500632,X:+:84510265-84510265
(this also uses remote ensembl server)



Comparing new grass using ensembl server, and new grass using Vagrent generated ensembl cache file. Example commands...

PanCan grass (in git) command - using remote ensembl server (for comparison with cache ensembl file):
perl -I /software/CGP/projects/vagrent_vcf/perl/modules/ ~/CGP_git/grass/bin/grass.pl -species HUMAN -ensembl_api /software/pubseq/PerlModules/Ensembl/www_74_1 -coord X:-:84500101-84500632,X:+:84510265-84510265

PanCan grass (in git) command - using cache ensembl file:
perl -I /software/CGP/projects/vagrent_vcf/perl/modules/ ~/CGP_git/grass/bin/grass.pl  -genome_cache /lustre/scratch104/sanger/am3/vagrent/Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.74.vagrent.cache.gz  -coord X:-:84500101-84500632,X:+:84510265-84510265

Note that the ensembl cache file isn't an exact copy of ensembl server db since gene names were applied after downloading the cache file precursor, using the most up to date CCDS names available.
