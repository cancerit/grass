Gene Rearrangement AnalySiS

Takes pairs of coordinates describing potential rearrangement events and predicts the 'most interesting' fusion consequences that could occur.

# Input

Each end coordinate may be exact or can be represented as a range.

Either an Ensembl server or an Ensembl genome cache file (generated by [VAGrENT](http://cancerit.github.io/VAGrENT/)) must be available to supply the gene information used in the annotation process.

We recommend using a cache file as this is significantly quicker.

# Usage

    perl grass.pl -genome_cache /<path_to>/<species>.<ref>.<ensembl_ver>.vagrent.cache.gz  -coord <coord_str>

or

    perl grass.pl -species HUMAN -ensembl_api /<path_to>/<ensembl_api> -coord <coord_str>

or

    perl grass.pl -genome_cache /<path_to>/<species>.<ref>.<ensembl_ver>.vagrent.cache.gz  -file <file_of_coords>

examples...

    grass.pl  -genome_cache Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.74.vagrent.cache.gz -coord  3:-:129389225,3:-:129390103,AA
    grass.pl -species HUMAN -ensembl_api www_74_1 -r_file PD1234a.AllDisruptions.txt
    grass.pl  -genome_cache Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.74.vagrent.cache.gz -coord 2:+:188365485-188365837,2:+:188417763-188418155 -list_between

Note that the ensembl cache file isn't an exact copy of ensembl server db since gene names are applied after downloading the cache file precursor, using the most up to date CCDS names available.

## Options

Please see the help generated by ```grass.pl``` when executed with no parameters for up-to-date information.
